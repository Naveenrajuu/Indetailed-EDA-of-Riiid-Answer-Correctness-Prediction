##About Problem Statement:

Tailoring education to a student's ability level is one of the many valuable things an AI tutor can do.In this competetion we had provided with the some sorts of information a complete education app would have: that student's historic performance, the performance of other students on the same question, metadata about the question itself, and more.So, based on this history if create a ML model to predict how students will perform on future interactions,then it will bridge the gap between the student performance and his learning skills.It will help tackle global challenges in education. If successful, it’s possible that any student with an Internet connection can enjoy the benefits of a personalized learning experience, regardless of where they live.

About the data:

Riiid Labs, an AI solutions provider delivering creative disruption to the education market, empowers global education players to rethink traditional ways of learning leveraging AI. With a strong belief in equal opportunity in education, Riiid launched an AI tutor based on deep-learning algorithms in 2017 that attracted more than one million South Korean students.This year, the company released EdNet, the world’s largest open database for AI education containing more than 100 million student interactions.So,all we need to do is to pair your machine learning skills using Riiid’s EdNet data.

Objective:

Tailoring education to a student's ability level is one of the many valuable things an AI tutor can do.So,In this competition,challenge is to create algorithms for "Knowledge Tracing," the modeling of student knowledge over time i.e you will predict whether students are able to answer their next questions correctly
